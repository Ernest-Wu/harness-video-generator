# Reliable Dev Harness

A dual-track product development harness combining spec-driven skill design with hard-gate engineering discipline. Supports both software development and content production workflows.

[中文文档](README-zh.md)

## Core Idea

> Vibe Coding fails not because models are dumb, but because there is no system around the model.

This harness provides:
- **Guides (前馈控制)**: Skills that inject methodology and acceptance criteria before any work begins
- **Sensors (反馈控制)**: Deterministic hooks and exit-check scripts that physically block bad output from moving forward
- **Steering Loop (进化层)**: Feedback accumulates into proposals, but **humans must confirm** before rules change
- **Context Firewall (执行隔离)**: Every Sub-Agent task runs in a fresh instance with zero inherited context

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install in your project

```bash
# Option A: Copy directly (recommended for existing projects)
cp -r /path/to/harness-video-generator/.claude /your/project/

# Option B: Use the init script
cd /your/project
/path/to/harness-video-generator/scripts/init-harness.sh .

# Verify installation
python3 .claude/check-harness.py
# → ✅ Harness health check passed. Both dev/ and content/ domains are intact.
```

### Step 2: Use Dev Track (Software Development)

Start a conversation with Claude Code in your project. The Orchestrator reads `CLAUDE.md` and routes automatically:

```text
You: "I want to build a user authentication system"

Claude will:
  1. Route to dev/product-spec-builder → writes L2-spec
  2. Run exit-check.py → blocks if spec is incomplete
  3. You confirm the spec (Creative Gate)
  4. Route to dev/design-brief-builder → writes L3-design
  5. ... continues through dev-planner → dev-builder → code-review → release
  6. Each step: Hard Gate (exit-check.py) blocks bad output
```

**You do**: Confirm specs, make design decisions, review quality.
**Harness does**: Enforce flow, run validation, block incomplete work.

### Step 3: Use Content Track (Oral Video Production)

```text
You: "帮我把这个口播稿做成短视频"

Claude will:
  1. Route to content/script-writer → parses script → scenes.json
  2. Hard Gate: validates JSON structure
  3. Creative Gate: you confirm platform (9:16/16:9/4:5) + Mood + scene breakdown
  4. Route to content/visual-designer → generates HTML slides
  5. Creative Gate: you select style from 3 previews
  6. Route to content/tts-engine → generates audio + subtitles
  7. Route to content/video-compositor → renders final video
  8. Creative Gate: you approve the final video
```

**You do**: Choose platform/style, confirm scenes, approve quality.
**Harness does**: Generate assets, validate outputs, ensure pipeline consistency.

### Step 4: CLI Tools (optional)

```bash
# Check which skill a request routes to
python3 .claude/router.py "build login page"
# → dev/dev-builder

python3 .claude/router.py "制作口播视频" --domain content
# → content/script-writer

# Validate a content skill's output
python3 .claude/skills/content/script-writer/exit-check.py
# → ❌ [file_missing] scenes.json does not exist
# → ✅ script-writer exit check passed

# Health check
python3 .claude/check-harness.py
# → ✅ Harness health check passed
```

## Dual-Track System

The harness now supports two domains, each with its own skill chain and gate types:

### Dev Track (Software Development)

```
idea → product-spec-builder → design-brief-builder → design-maker
  → dev-planner → dev-builder → code-review → release-builder
  [Hard Gate: exit-check.py at each step]
  [PM Gates: G0→G1→G2→G3+G3b→G4→G5 with human decision points]
```

### Content Track (Oral Video Production)

```
script/topic → script-writer → visual-designer → tts-engine → video-compositor
  [Hard Gate: exit-check.py] + [Creative Gate: human confirmation]
  [PM Gates: CG0→CG1→CG2→CG3→CG4→CG5 with human decision points]
```

Content track uses **Dual Gates**: deterministic exit-check.py (Hard Gate) PLUS human judgment points (Creative Gate) for style, pacing, and quality decisions.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Every Skill has an exit-check.py**
   Natural language rules are unreliable. `exit-check.py` is a physical gate.

2. **Steering Loop has a Human Gate**
   `evolution-runner` may only generate proposals. It cannot directly modify Skill files.

3. **Design Mockup > Design Brief > Product Spec** (dev track)
   Visual ambiguity kills UI quality. The mockup is the single source of truth.

4. **Hard Gate + Creative Gate** (content track)
   Deterministic checks (file exists, JSON valid) + human judgment (does this look good?). Creative Gates are not skippable by default.

5. **Sub-Agent Context Firewall**
   Each task is a fresh instance. State is passed through `.claude/state/` files only.

6. **Domain-Aware Routing**
   `router.py` supports `--domain dev|content` to restrict routing to a specific domain. When domain is ambiguous, the Orchestrator asks the user.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Exit Code ≠ 0 means **stop**. No exceptions.
- Code changes must pass `code-review` before commit.
- No automatic rule changes without human approval.
- UI changes must sync the design mockup.
- Creative Gates in content track are not skippable unless explicitly configured.
- Content Steering Loop threshold: ≥5 same-type feedback (vs dev ≥3).
