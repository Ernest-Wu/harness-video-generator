name: bug-fixer
description: Systematic four-stage debugging without guesswork. Use when a build fails, test fails, or review finds a defect.
intent: Apply a doctor-like diagnostic process to debugging - collect evidence, compare patterns, form hypotheses, test them one by one, then implement and verify. Prevents trial-and-error coding that introduces new bugs.
type: interactive
triggers: ["bug", "fix", "error", "crash", "broken", "failing test"]

## Purpose

Debug systematically using the scientific method. No guesswork. No changing five things at once.

## Key Concepts

- Evidence first - read the full error and stack trace
- Compare pattern - find a working similar feature and diff it
- Hypothesis validation - test at most 3 hypotheses, one at a time
- Single change rule - one logical fix per attempt
- Regression check - verify the fix does not break existing tests

## Application

### Stage 1: Collect Evidence
1. Read the complete error message and stack trace
2. Reproduce the bug - is it stable or intermittent?
3. Check recent code changes (git diff)
4. Trace data flow from trigger to crash

### Stage 2: Pattern Analysis
1. Find a similar feature that works correctly
2. Identify differences between working and broken code
3. List suspicious lines or assumptions

### Stage 3: Hypothesis Validation
1. Form at most 3 hypotheses, ranked by likelihood
2. Test the most likely hypothesis with the smallest possible change
3. If hypothesis is wrong, record why and move to the next

### Stage 4: Implement and Verify
1. Make exactly one logical change
2. Compile / build
3. Run the failing test - does it pass now?
4. Run the full test suite - did you break anything else?

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Changing Multiple Things at Once
**Fix:** One change at a time. Otherwise you cannot know what fixed it.

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring the Stack Trace
**Fix:** Read the full trace. The answer is usually in the first few frames.

### Pitfall 3: The Same Bug Repeatedly
**Fix:** If a bug survives 3 fix attempts, stop. Re-examine the architecture or your understanding of the problem.

## Output

After completing the fix, write `.claude/state/LAST_BUGFIX.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
# Bug Fix Report

## Hypothesis
{What you think is wrong and why}

## Evidence
{Stack trace, error logs, data flow analysis}

## Root Cause
{The confirmed cause after hypothesis validation}

## Fix
{What was changed and why}

## Test Verification
- Failing test: {test name} → PASS
- Regression: full test suite → PASS / {any failures}

## Business Impact
- Priority: {Must have | Should have | Could have | Won't have}
- User impact: {who is affected and how}
```

## Exit-Check Criteria

Run `exit-check.py` to verify:

1. **HARD GATE**: `LAST_BUGFIX.md` must exist — bug-fixer must document the fix
2. **HARD GATE**: Report must contain at least one of: hypothesis, evidence, or root cause
3. **HARD GATE**: Report must be at least 100 characters
4. **WARNING**: 3+ attempt markers suggest architectural review is needed
5. **INFO**: Test verification and business impact are recommended but not blocking
