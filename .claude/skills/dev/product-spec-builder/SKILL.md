  Guide users from fuzzy ideas to decision-ready product specifications through multi-turn discovery. The output is not for humans to read—it's a execution baseline for downstream Skills (design-brief-builder, dev-planner, dev-builder, code-review).

## Purpose

Turn vague product ideas into structured, AI-readable product specifications through adaptive questioning. This is not a human-facing PRD—it's an **execution contract** for all downstream Skills.

Use this when:
- Starting a new product or feature
- Scope feels fuzzy and keeps changing
- You need downstream Agents (designer, developer, reviewer) to align on the same baseline

## Key Concepts

### The Spec as Execution Contract
A good Product-Spec is **machine-readable first, human-readable second**. It must contain:
1. **Problem Statement** — Who is blocked, what are they trying to do, why it matters
2. **Target User** — Specific persona, not "general users"
3. **Core Features** — 3-7 bullet points, each with a user outcome
4. **Success Metrics** — Quantified, time-bound, verifiable
5. **Scope Boundaries** — Explicit In-Scope and Out-of-Scope
6. **Key Decisions** — Product-level tradeoffs already made

### PM Discovery Gate (G0)
This skill produces the input for the **PM Discovery Gate**. Before proceeding to design, verify:
- [ ] Problem statement is quantified (not just "users are frustrated")
- [ ] Target user is specific (name a persona, not "everyone")
- [ ] Success metrics are linked to business goals
- [ ] Features are prioritized (P0/P1/P2) with MVP boundary defined
- [ ] At least one assumption is explicitly listed

### Entry Modes
Offer three modes:
1. **Guided** — I ask you 8-12 questions one at a time (recommended for new projects)
2. **Context Dump** — You paste everything you know; I fill gaps only
3. **Best Guess** — I infer from minimal input and label all assumptions

### Problem Framing Framework (from problem-statement)

Every spec must start with a **user-centered problem statement**, not a feature wish list. Use this narrative structure:

- **I am:** [Describe the persona experiencing the problem — 3-4 key characteristics]
- **Trying to:** [Desired outcome the persona cares about]
- **But:** [Barriers preventing the outcome]
- **Because:** [Root cause — push past symptoms to underlying issues]
- **Which makes me feel:** [Emotional impact — use real language, not marketing copy]

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- **Solution smuggling:** "The problem is we lack AI-powered analytics" → Reframe around the user outcome
- **Business problem disguised as user problem:** "Our revenue is down" → Dig into why users churn
- **Generic persona:** "Busy professionals" → Get specific: "Sales rep managing 50+ leads in spreadsheets"
- **Symptom instead of root cause:** "Because the UI is confusing" → Ask "Why?" 5 times

### Proto-Persona Framework (from proto-persona)

Before writing features, define **who** you're building for with a proto-persona:

- **Name:** Alliterative, memorable (e.g., "Manager Mike," "Startup Sarah")
- **Bio & Demographics:** Age, location, career, context-relevant details
- **Pains:** Specific frustrations (not "frustrated with tools" → "Spends 3 hrs/week copying data between tools")
- **Goals:** Observable outcomes, not tasks
- **Decision Authority:** Can they buy your solution? Budget limits?
- **Decision Influencers:** Who shapes their choices?

Mark assumptions with `[ASSUMPTION—VALIDATE]` tags. Proto-personas are hypotheses to validate, not facts.

### Prioritization Framework (from prioritization-advisor)

Choose the right prioritization method based on product stage:

| Product Stage | Recommended Framework | Why |
|--------------|----------------------|-----|
| Pre-PMF | ICE or Value/Effort 2×2 | Speed > rigor when you don't know what works |
| Early PMF, scaling | RICE (Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort) | Data-driven when you have metrics |
| Mature, optimizing | Kano or Opportunity Scoring | Separate basics from delight at scale |

**Key principles:**
- **RICE** = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort — best when usage data exists
- **ICE** = Impact × Confidence × Ease — lightweight, good when data is thin
- **Kano Model** — classify features as Basic (must-have), Performance (more=better), Delight (unexpected value)
- **Value vs. Effort 2×2** — Quick Wins (high value, low effort) vs. Strategic Bets (high value, high effort)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Framework whiplash (switching every quarter) → Stick with one for 6-12 months
- Treating scores as gospel → PM judgment overrides when strategic context demands
- Solo PM scoring → Collaborative sessions with engineering and design

## Application

### Entry Mode (via workshop-facilitation protocol)
Offer three modes:
1. **Guided** — I ask you 8-12 questions one at a time
2. **Context Dump** — You paste everything you know; I fill gaps only
3. **Best Guess** — I infer from minimal input and label all assumptions

**Q1: Target User**
"Who is the primary user? Describe their situation and what they're trying to accomplish."

**Q2: Core Problem**
"What is the most painful/frustrating part of their current workflow?"

**Q3: Proposed Solution (1 sentence)**
"If you had to describe the product in one sentence, what does it do?"

**Q4: Core Features**
"List the 3-5 most important capabilities. For each, answer: what user outcome does it enable?"

**Q5: Success Metrics**
"How will you know this product is working? Give at least one number (conversion rate, time saved, retention, etc.)."

**Q6: Scope Boundaries**
"What is explicitly NOT included in the first version?"

**Q7: Platform / Format**
"Web app, mobile app, desktop app, browser extension, CLI, or API?"

**Q8: Key Constraints**
"Any hard constraints? (timeline, budget, regulatory, must-use tech, offline requirement)"

**Q9-Q12:** Adaptive follow-ups based on previous answers.

### Output Format

Write the final spec to `.claude/state/L2-spec.md` using this structure:

```markdown
# Product Spec: {Project Name}

## Problem Statement
{Who} struggles with {what} because {root cause}, leading to {consequence}.

## Target User
- **Primary:** {persona + situation}
- **Secondary (optional):** {persona}

## Core Solution (1 sentence)
{A single sentence description}

## Core Features
1. **{Feature name}** — Enables {user outcome}
2. ...

## Success Metrics
- {Metric 1}: move from {baseline} to {target} within {timeframe}
- ...

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- ...

**Out of Scope (v1):**
- ...

## Key Decisions
- {Tradeoff decision 1}
- ...

## Business Goal
{What business objective does this product/feature serve? Link to company strategy if applicable.}

## Assumptions
- {Assumption 1}: {validation status — unvalidated / validated / partially validated}
- {Assumption 2}: ...

## Feature Priority
### P0 (MVP — Must Have)
- {feature} — {user outcome}

### P1 (Should Have)
- {feature} — {user outcome}

### P2 (Nice to Have)
- {feature} — {user outcome}

## MVP Boundary
**In MVP (Phase 0):** {list MVP-must features}
**Post MVP (Phase 1+):** {list features for later phases}
```

### After Output
Run `exit-check.py` before claiming completion.

## Examples

### Good: AI Novel Writing Tool
**Problem:** Indie authors waste 40% of their creative energy on formatting, continuity tracking, and scene outlining instead of writing.
**Solution:** A web-based novel editor that auto-tracks character continuity and generates scene outlines from plot beats.
**Scope:** In = editor, continuity checker, outline generator. Out = publishing distribution, collaborative editing, mobile app.
**Metrics:** Author weekly word count increases 25% within 30 days of onboarding.

### Bad: "A platform for writers"
**Why bad:** No specific user, no specific problem, no metrics, no scope boundaries. Every downstream Agent will guess differently.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Solution-First Thinking
**Symptom:** Spec starts with "We'll build an AI app that..." without describing who needs it and why.

**Fix:** Always lead with Problem Statement. If you can't name the user and their pain, stop here.

### Pitfall 2: Scope Creep in the Spec
**Symptom:** Out of Scope is empty or vague ("maybe later").

**Fix:** Out of Scope must be explicit and uncomfortable. If it hurts to leave something out, you're doing it right.

### Pitfall 3: Metrics Theater
**Symptom:** "Improve user experience" or "Make writers more productive."

**Fix:** Every metric must have a number, a baseline, and a timeframe. "25% increase in weekly word count within 30 days" is a metric. "Better UX" is not.
